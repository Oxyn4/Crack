# Crack
## Description

Crack is a simple hash cracker. It doesnt have much functionality as its just for me to practise making hacking tools.

## Usage

When calling the crack.py using python in the command line, you need to specify two positional arguments.

    > a text file containg the desired hash to crack. The hash needs to be on line 1 of the file with no spaces.

    > a desired worslist required to crack the hash.

**both** of these need to be specified in that order. Note if the files are not in the working directory **specify their file path**.
